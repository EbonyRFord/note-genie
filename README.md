Project Name:
Note- Genie

Project Description:
The Note Genie was created for students to easily take notes and categorize them with a subject line. Having a note taker that can be used on your laptop or iphone allows for ease of access and can replace the handwritten note taking. 

The use of this application pairs well for online instruction of courses.
